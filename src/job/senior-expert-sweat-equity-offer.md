We believe your guidance and expertise will significantly contribute to our growth and success.

### Company Overview

Startr LLC, a Wyoming-based company, is transforming the EdTech industry. With a focus on innovation, transparency, and collaboration, we aim to build an open-source ecosystem that fosters significant change.

### Role Details
