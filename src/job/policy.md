# **Flexible Work Policy**

At Startr LLC, we value flexibility. We trust our team to deliver excellence, wherever they choose to work.

## **Remote Work**

You can work from anywhere. Whether it's your home, a coffee shop, or a co-working space, as long as you stay connected and productive.

## **Offices**

Choose to work from our partner organizations' offices. Enjoy new environments and collaborate with different teams. It's a great way to grow and share ideas. 

If you prefer a dedicated space? Visit our Montreal or Portugal offices. These hubs are equipped with everything you need to succeed. Meet colleagues, access resources, and thrive in a supportive setting.

## **Communication and Productivity**

Stay in touch. Use our our in house tools along side eMail and Signal to communicate regularly. Clear and consistent communication ensures we all stay aligned and move forward together.

We keep things simple and focus on results. We measure success by what you achieve, not where you work. Set your goals, manage your time, and deliver outstanding work.

## **Support**

Need help? Our team is here for you. Whether you’re remote or in-office, support is just a message away. We ensure you have what you need to perform your best.

## **Balance**

Maintain a healthy work-life balance. Flexible work means you can manage your time effectively. Take breaks, set boundaries, and stay energized.

## **Respect**

Respect each other’s choices. Embrace the diversity of work environments. Trust and mutual respect are the foundation of our flexible work culture. We support one another with courage and honesty. Our respect for diversity unites us.

# **Conclusion**

Flexibility fuels our success. Choose the work style that suits you best and contribute to our collective achievement. Together, we build a dynamic and thriving Startr LLC.
